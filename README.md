# Me_Bot
A simple tool to make a bot that speaks like you, simply learning from your WhatsApp Chats.

Instructions:-

1. From WhatsApp on your phone, go to any chat and export it by going into the settings. Move the txt file that you receive inside the Me_Bot folder.

2. Run the clean_whatsapp_chats.py script using the command. Before running, change the names of the people by changing YOUR_NAME and OTHER_NAME in the scripts according to the txt file you have for your chats.

`python clean_whatsapp_chats.py whatsapp_chat.txt`

3. Run the prepare_files.ipynb ipython notebook.

4. Run the Me_Bot.ipynb file and you can play with the bot at the bottom!
